Changed InterfaceModule and OnyxNetwork back to the original. Build the network until you get a successful build. After that, we test with OnyxTest.py and see whether the segfault is obviated or not.

If not obviated, we go after Configuration and Chain objects. Because we didn't have a segfault when we ran the onyx alone. Regardless of the situation, we return to the complete version portion by portion to make sure we don't face segfault again.

Do not give in. Stay persistent and the problem reveals itself.
